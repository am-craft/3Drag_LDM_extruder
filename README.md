# 3Drag LDM mod
This repository contain all the modification made on 3Drag 3D printers @ [+LAB](www.piulab.it).

LDM (liquid Deposition Modeling) is a particular 3D printer process in which viscous fluid are extruded from a reservoir and deposited on the build plate. This process is more generally called Direct Ink Writing (DIW).

## 3Drag LDM Extruder
The third version of the LDM extruder was developed with the porpuse of making a modular extruder, easy to assemble and disasseble.
- The syringe holder is stronger of the previour version and can be used to easily mount syringe from 10ml to 60ml.
- The extruder assembly is divided into three main parts. If one component broke you can easily switch is without disassembling all the extruder.
- The completely redesigned drive unit is stronger and smoother. The M8 screw has been substituted with a T8 lead screw.

BOM
